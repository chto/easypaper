Given a LaTeX document, compile a rich HTML document.  Current goal is to have three main functions:

- Hover over bibliographic reference (e.g. Smith and Bob 2001): tooltip with bibliographic info (author and title) and possibly abstract and link to bibliographic entry (e.g. in ADS or arXiv) is displayed
- Hover over figure or equation reference: tooltip with figure or equation is displayed
- Highlight jargon words, tooltip with definition and/or link for more info
