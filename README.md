    - _Trigger_: Click or hover over bibliographic reference (e.g. Smith and Bob 2001)
    - _Result_:  Tooltip/sidebar with bibliographic info, optional abstract, and link to bibliographic entry (e.g. in ADS or arXiv) is displayed.

1. **View figures, equations, and tables with minimal interruption**
    - _Trigger_: Click or hover over figure, equation, or table reference.
    - _Result_:  Tooltip/sidebar containing figure, equation, or table is displayed, with options to resize as necessary.

1. **Look up unfamiliar jargon**
    - _Trigger_: Click or hover over "jargon"
    - _Result_:  Tooltip with short definition (pulled from some yet-unknown database) and links for more info, or a search link
