Given a LaTeX document, compile a rich HTML document.  Current goal is to have three main functions:

1. Easy-to-follow citation links
..* Trigger: Click or hover over bibliographic reference (e.g. Smith and Bob 2001)
..* Action:  Tooltip with bibliographic info, optional abstract, and link to bibliographic entry (e.g. in ADS or arXiv) is displayed.
1. Easy-to-reference figures, equations, and tables
..* Trigger: Click or hover over figure or equation reference.
..* Action:  Tooltip with figure or equation is displayed, with options to resize as necessary.
1. Easy lookup of jargon
..* Trigger: Click or hover over "jargon"
..* Action:  Tooltip with short definition (pulled from some yet-unknown database) and links for more info, or a search link
