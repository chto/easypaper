					Abstract

				<p>
				We derive new formulae to calculate volumes, moments, and polynomial integrals up to
				quadratic order over polytopes in two and three dimensions. In principle, our method can
				be used to derive analogous formulae for polynomials of any order in any dimensionality.
				By successively applying the divergence theorem, we reduce the dimensionality of the
				integrals from volumes to areas to lines to points. We arrive at closed-form expressions
				involving data local to the vertices that define the polytope, with no need for the
			entire polytope to be explicitly represented all at once. In addition, there are no
			latent assumptions regarding the convexity or connectedness of the domain. The form of
			these expressions is particularly well-suited to software implementations.
			</p>

			<p>
			We apply these formulae to the case of voxelizing polytopes using an exact
			volume-sampling approach, including the voxelization of polytopes with linearly and
			quadratically varying densities. We take particular care to avoid loss of numerical
			precision, achieving machine precision on a per-voxel level. We also give a brief
			performance analysis, comparing our volume-sampling method to point multisampling, as
			well as scaling in shared-memory parallelization.
			</p>

			<p>
			Noting that this method is useful for exact remeshing operations on arbitrary grid
			topologies, we finally discuss a number of further application areas such as Arbitrary
			Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrodynamics, projecting three dimensional manifolds from six
			dimensional phase space to configuration space, and computer graphics.

		<h2><span class="section-number">1&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Introduction</h2>

		<p>
		I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic.
		My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled
		several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him
		for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days
		perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented
		his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the
		father of a family.
	</p>

		<p>The annihilation rate of dark matter can be written in terms of the local velocity
		distrubution $f(v)$ as
		\begin{equation}
			\Phi = \frac{1}{2} \int \int \, f(v_i, x) \, f(v_j, x) \, 
				\sigma(v_{ij}) \, v_{ij} \, \mathrm{d}v_i \, \mathrm{d}v_j
		\end{equation}	

		where $v_{ij} = |v_i - v_j|$ is the relative velocity.

		As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from
		relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing
		state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort,
		was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion
		in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.
		Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
		daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved
		Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these
		unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a
		conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring
		to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit
		and assistance.

		Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my
		father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which
		was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone
		welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his
		fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the
		meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant’s house. The interval
		was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he
		had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end
		of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.
	</p>

		<p>
		His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their
		little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. But
		Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her
		in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived
		to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.
	</p>

		<p>
		Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely
		occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her
		father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her,
		and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He
		came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after
		the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection
		of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.
	</p>

		<p>
		There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance
		seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense of justice
		in my father’s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to
		love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered
		unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There
		was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from
		the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to
		be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which
		gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes
		and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the
		gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite
		pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity
		of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the
		two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished
		all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought
